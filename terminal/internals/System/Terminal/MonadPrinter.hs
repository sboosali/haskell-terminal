-- | This class describes an environment that Unicode text can be printed to.
--   This might either be file or a terminal.
--
--    * Instances shall implement the concept of lines and line width.
--    * Instances shall implement the concept of a carriage that can be
--      set to the beginning of the next line.
--    * It is assumed that the carriage automatically moves to the beginning
--      of the next line if the end of the current line is reached.
--    * Instances shall be Unicode aware or must at least be able to print
--      a replacement character.
--    * Implementations must be aware of infinite lazy `Prelude.String`s and
--      long `Data.Text.Text`s. `String`s should be printed character wise as
--      evaluating them might trigger exceptions at any point. Long text should
--      be printed chunk wise in order to stay interruptible.
--    * Implementations must not use an unbounded output buffer. Print operations
--      shall block and be interruptible when the output buffer is full.
--    * Instances shall not pass control characters in text to the printer (not even line break).
--      Control characters shall be replaced with ï¿½. Text formatting shall be done
--      with the designated classes extending `MonadMarkupPrinter`.
--      Allowing control sequences would cause a dependency on certain terminal
--      types, but also pose an underrated security risk as modern terminals are
--      highly programmable and should not be fed with untrusted input.

    --      often in order to adapt to changes in line width.
